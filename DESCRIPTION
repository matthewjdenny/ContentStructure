Description:  This package provide functions to estimate an as-yet unnamed extension and generalization of the TPME model introduced in Krafft et al. (2012). Samplers are written in  C++ and use the Boost libraries. The Model currently expects 0-1 binary mixing covaries and should scale up to a maximum of about 10-20,000 emails sent by up to 50-100 senders and still run in a few weeks.
